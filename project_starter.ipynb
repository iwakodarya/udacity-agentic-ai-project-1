    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

The group consists of Yuri, who is 30 and enjoys tennis, cooking, comedy, and technology, and Hiro, who is 25 with interests in reading, music, theatre, and art. Your budget for the trip is comfortable at 130, and the planned itinerary totals well within this limit.\n",
       "\n",
       "On June 10th, the weather will be clear with a warm temperature around 31°C, perfect for outdoor activities. You’ll start with “Artful Athletics: Paint & Play Extravaganza” at Creative Courts Park. This fun event merges art and sports, allowing you to engage in painting collaborative murals inspired by sports, followed by friendly mini sports games. It beautifully fits both Hiro’s love of art and Yuri’s interest in sports like tennis. Later in the evening, you can enjoy the “AgentsVille Twilight Writing Escape” at The Ink Loft. This cozy, indoor writing event includes group prompts and readings—an ideal way to unwind and indulge in creativity while matching Hiro’s interests in reading and art.\n",
       "\n",
       "On June 11th, expect partly cloudy skies and warmer temperatures near 34°C. The day begins with the \"Morning Groove Dance Party\" indoors, featuring energetic dance routines and great music. This lively event pairs well with Hiro’s passion for music and dancing, offering a joyful start to the day regardless of the weather. In the afternoon, the “AgentsVille Art & Music Fusion Fest” awaits at the Echo Gardens Amphitheater. Here, you can enjoy vibrant live music and explore an interactive outdoor art gallery, combining two of Hiro’s favorite interests in a relaxing garden setting.\n",
       "\n",
       "The final day, June 12th, comes with a chance of thunderstorms and a cooler temperature around 28°C, so indoor options are prioritized. Midday, the “Soundtrack Picnic: Lunchtime Movies & Melodies” event offers a unique blend of classic film scenes and live music at Starlight Amphitheater, with an indoor backup plan in case of rain. This celebration of movies and music aligns well with Hiro’s and Yuri’s shared interests. To close the trip, the “Tech & Film Fusion Night” at the Virtual Reality Theater provides a futuristic and immersive experience where technology and cinema intersect. This event promises engaging discussions and screenings that cater especially to Yuri’s love of technology and Hiro’s enthusiasm for movies.\n",
